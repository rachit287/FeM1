### What I learned


To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
  <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com">
  <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter:wght@400;700&family=Lexend+Deca&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">

```
```css
.content-box{
  height : 300px;
  width : 450px;
  background-color :  hsl(244, 38%, 16%);
  text-align: left;
  padding : 50px 50px 50px 50px;
  display : inline-block;
  position : absolute;
  top : 200px;
  left : 200px;
  border-radius: 12px 0 0 12px;

}
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

### Continued development

Need to learn more and more about Bootstrap, as I could not make the site optimized for mobile viewing. Need to learn more about CSS Filters and overlays.
